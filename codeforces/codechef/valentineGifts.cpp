// Chef is planning to gift something to Chefina on each of the

// 7 days of valentine week. He has a total budget of
// ï¿½
// X rupees.

// Find whether he can plan a series of gifts such that:

// Each gift has a positive value;
// The value of a gift is at least twice the value of previous gift.
// Note that we do not consider any previous gift for the first gift, and thus the first gift can be of any positive value.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if Chef can plan a series of gifts such that each gift is at least twice the value of previous gift. Otherwise, print NO.

// You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
