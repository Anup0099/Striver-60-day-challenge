// To begin with, let's learn how to reconstruct an array from its prefix sum array. This can be done by calculating the differences between adjacent elements.

// If the element nâˆ—(n+1)/2
//  is missing from the array, we will add it and check if the array corresponds to some permutation.

// Otherwise, there is a missing element in the middle or at the beginning of the array.

// Let's count the occurrences of each difference between adjacent elements. Obviously, we should have one extra number and 2
//  missing numbers.

// If the count of differences occurring at least 2
//  times is at least 2
// , the answer is NO
// .

// The answer is also NO
//  if any difference occurs at least 3
//  times.

// Otherwise, we check that exactly 2
//  distinct numbers are missing, and their sum is equal to the only duplicate.
