// Monocarp always starts his morning with a good ol' sandwich. Sandwiches Monocarp makes always consist of bread, cheese and/or ham.

// A sandwich always follows the formula:

// a piece of bread
// a slice of cheese or ham
// a piece of bread
// …
// a slice of cheese or ham
// a piece of bread
// So it always has bread on top and at the bottom, and it alternates between bread and filling, where filling is a slice of either cheese or ham. Each piece of bread and each slice of cheese or ham is called a layer.

// Today Monocarp woke up and discovered that he has b
//  pieces of bread, c
//  slices of cheese and h
//  slices of ham. What is the maximum number of layers his morning sandwich can have?

// Input
// The first line contains a single integer t
//  (1≤t≤1000
// ) — the number of testcases.

// Each testcase consists of three integers b,c
//  and h
//  (2≤b≤100
// ; 1≤c,h≤100
// ) — the number of pieces of bread, slices of cheese and slices of ham, respectively.

// Output
// For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum number of layers Monocarp's morning sandwich can have.
