{
    // you are given 0-indexed 2d matrix grid size 3*3 represent number of stones in each cell the grid contains exaclty 9 stones and there can canbe multiple stones in each cell in one move in one move you can move single stones from its current stone return minimum number of moves required to place one stone in each cell ? mane minimum time boleche mane dynamic programming

    int n=grid.size();
